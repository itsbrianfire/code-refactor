A marketing agency has reached out to me to refactor their existing site to make it more accessible and optimized for search engines.

## Criteria Includes...

```
Semantic HTML elements in the source code

The structure of the HTML elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning

Icon and image elements include accessible alt attributes
 
Heading attributes fall in sequential order

A concise yet descriptive title element
```

While the front-end of this website remains the same, I organized the the HTML to make it more accessible using alt attributes and left comments in both the HTML and CSS detailing what I did with the code given to me and why.

```
The way to run/ use this application is via this link: file:///Users/brian/GT-ATL-VIRT-FSF-PT-12-2021-U-C/01-HTML-Git-CSS/02-Homework/Develop/index.html
